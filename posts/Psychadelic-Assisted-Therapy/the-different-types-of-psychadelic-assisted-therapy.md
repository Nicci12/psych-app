## What is Psychadelic Therapy?

"Psychedelic therapy (sometimes referred to as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP) is a type of psychiatric practice that involves ingesting a psychedelic substance as part of a psychotherapeutic process.

In psychedelic therapy, the use of psychedelics is typically combined with talk therapy.

A range of consciousness-altering psychedelic drugs are currently being used or researched for therapeutic purposes in both clinical and nonclinical settings.

Some are derived from plants, like psilocybin (magic mushrooms), DMT, peyote, ayahuasca, and ibogaine. Others — including ketamine, MDMA, and LSD — are chemical compounds.

While Indigenous communities have used psychedelics in therapeutic and religious settings for centuries, psychedelic therapy is relatively new in Western clinical settings.

It’s becoming more popular with increased legalization of certain psychedelic substances, a rise in mental health conditions, and a lull in psychopharmacological research."

## The Different Types of Psychadelics used During Psychadelic Assisted Therapy

### Ketamine

"Ketamine is the most-studied psychedelic drug for mental health therapy.

In low doses, it has shown to be beneficial in numerous trials exploring its potential to treat depression, but its effects are short-lived.

For people with severe depression, for example, researchTrusted Source shows significant improvement after treatment, and results last about 6 to 8 weeks, on average.

These findings have led to the development of a drug called Spravato. It’s a nasal spray that delivers the active ketamine ingredient. However, intravenous ketamine administration is considered to be more effective and less expensive"

### MDMA

"Multiple phase 2 clinical trialsTrusted Source (PUT A LINK HERE) — which are done to discern whether a treatment works — suggest that MDMA can treat PTSD symptoms for up to 4 years.

Researchers have also completed a phase 3 trialTrusted Source, which determines whether a treatment works better than what’s currently available, involving MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD. This was the first phase 3 trial of any psychedelic-assisted therapy.

Among 90 participants with severe PTSD, 67 percent no longer qualified for a PTSD diagnosis after three treatments, and 88 percent had reduced symptoms of PTSD.

The trial sponsor, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, says the results could make way for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval by 2023"

### Psilocybin
"Psilocybin, the main compound in magic mushrooms, has shown positive resultsTrusted Source in treating depression and anxiety in people living with terminal illnesses.

Experts believeTrusted Source it could also help with obsessive-compulsive disorder, addiction, and treatment-resistant depression, but more research is needed"

### LSD
"LSD, a long lasting, potent psychedelic that’s considered to be the prototype for therapeutic psychedelics, has been shown to help with both alcohol use disorderTrusted Source and anxietyTrusted Source in people living with terminal illnesses"
