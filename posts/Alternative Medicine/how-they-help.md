## What is Alternative Medicine?
Alternative medicine is a term that describes medical treatments that are used instead of traditional (mainstream) therapies. Some people also refer to it as “integrative,” or “complementary” medicine.
More than half of adults in the United States say they use some form of alternative medicine. But exactly 
what types of therapies are considered alternative?

## The Different Types of Alternative Medicine
### Acupuncture
This is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that uses needles to stimulate specific points around the body. The person who performs this therapy (an acupuncturist) sticks thin, sterile needles into your skin. The goal is to help your body’s natural healing process kick in. Studies show that acupuncture can be effective in treating a number of conditions, like neck and back pain, nausea, anxiety, depression, insomnia, infertility, and more.

### Energy Therapies
These focus on the energy fields many people believe exist in and around the body. Included in this category are:

### Magnetic Field Therapy:
This uses magnetic or electrical fields to treat a number of musculoskeletal problems. Studies show that it may work for osteoarthritis and other pain conditions. Some studies have even shown that it may help fractures heal faster. Magnetic field therapy may not be safe if you’re pregnant, have an implanted cardiac device, use an insulin pump, or take a drug given by patch.

### Reiki: 
 Those who practice this alternative treatment believe it taps into the body's natural energy to speed healing. The practitioner hovers their hands over your body or places them lightly on your skin. The goal is to channel energy through their hands to your body to promote healing. 

### Therapeutic (“Healing”) Touch. 
 
 Here, a therapist uses their healing energy to identify and repair imbalances in a person’s energy field. Unlike Reiki, the therapist doesn’t touch you. They simply move their hands back and forth over your body. Research shows healing touch can reduce anxiety in people who have cancers. It can also increase their sense of well-being. But it’s unclear if it works for other issues, as well.

### Herbal Medicine
This alternative therapy uses parts of a plant -- its roots, leaves, berries, or flowers -- to heal the body.
According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 80% of people around the world use herbal medicine. Studies show certain herbs are effective in treating a number of health issues, like allergies, premenstrual syndrome, chronic fatigue, and more.

### Traditional Chinese Medicine
There are several frameworks for working within TCM to treat mental health concerns. Modern research explores how to use TCM principles and formulas to diagnose and address biomedically defined psychiatric conditions, providing a bridge between Eastern and Western conceptions of these imbalances. Practitioners of classical lineages of Chinese medicine will look to syndromes articulated in Zhang Zhong Jing’s “Jin Gui Yao Lue,” such as Lily Disease, Running Piglet Qi, Fright and Palpitation, and Vacuity Taxation, all of which have attributes that can resemble neuropsychiatric diseases. In expert hands, either method can be used effectively.

A common TCM framework for discussing psycho-emotional and other health concerns is the Five Phases model (sometimes called the Five Elements model). In this method, an individual experiencing an imbalance tracks their predominant emotions over time (sometimes with the help of a practitioner), takes notes of other symptoms, and looks to the corresponding elements and key bodily organs to guide diagnosis and treatment. Traditionally:

-Grief and sadness are associated with the Lungs.
-Worry and pensiveness are linked to the Spleen and digestion.
-Anger is associated with the Liver and Gallbladder.
-Joy is correlated with the Heart
-Fear and insecurity are said to relate to the Kidneys.
-Chinese remedies that tend to these organs on a physical and/or energetic level can help restore harmony to a person’s state of being on multiple levels.
