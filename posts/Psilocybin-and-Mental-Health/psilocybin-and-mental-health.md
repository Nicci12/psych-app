## What Is Psilocybin Therapy?

Psilocybin Therapy, also known as psilocybin-assisted therapy, psilocybin therapy involves the use of a psychedelic compound that is native to a specific type of mushroom in a psychotherapeutic setting.

Psilocybin mushrooms are colloquially known as "magic mushrooms" or "shrooms," and have been used for thousands of years as a spiritual and medicinal tool among Indigenous populations.1"

## What Psilocybin therapy looks like

"Psilocybin therapy involves a patient ingesting the chemical psilocybin while in the care of a therapist. The patient goes on a psychedelic journey in this controlled, safe environment, and the therapist facilitates their experience.

The session lasts six to eight hours, which is the full duration of the drug's effects. Though in some situations, patients may use the substance more than once. The general standard is that the psychedelic journey occurs a single time, with standard talk therapy often continuing after.

The goal of psilocybin therapy is to impact emotional obstacles and long-term problems in an expedient manner by utilizing the psychedelic journey, rather than spending months or years in talk therapy slowly working through them"
## The History of Psilocybin Therapy
"For many people, the notion of using a psychedelic drug for therapy might sound like something counterculture or fringe. That's not the case at all!

Psilocybin therapy is both studied and used by highly legitimate medical establishments such as Johns Hopkins. In fact, it was John Hopkins University that first received regulatory approval for psychedelic research in the year 2000, decades after the research and therapy were banned by the U.S. government in 1970.2

In 2006, the first research paper by Johns Hopkins was published on the positive long-term impact of using psilocybin in a therapeutic study.3 Since then, dozens of studies and academic papers4 have been published, with the overarching theme that the therapy offers solid, long-term positive impact for patients with a variety of conditions.

In 2021, Hopkins received a federal grant5

 for psychedelic treatment research, which was within a similar timeframe of some states beginning to decriminalize it. Currently, legislation has been passed in over a dozen states to make psilocybin more legal.6"

## What can benefit from Psilocybin Therapy?
"Psilocybin therapy is generally used for people with issues that may be refractory to conventional therapies.
Below are some of the populations who have been shown to benefit from psilocybin therapy."

#### Chronic Illness Patients
"For people with life-threatening cancer, a single dose of psilocybin was shown to dramatically reduce their depression and anxiety.7 The effects were long-lasting, with 60% to 80% of the group continuing to experience improvement in those symptoms over six months later.

Another study of cancer patients performed showed that over 80% continued to feel better over six months after the single-dose therapy.8 They reported improvements in their attitudes about life, their moods, and their sense of spirituality, as well as a reduction in their depression, anxiety, and feelings of dread or hopelessness about their illness."

#### People With Depression and Anxiety
"Both depression and anxiety can be serious, debilitating conditions that make people unable to go about their normal day-to-day lives.

For patients whose depression had previously been resistant to treatment, the results of studies have been no less profound. One study showed that 13 out of 20 patients experienced improvement, and for four of them, the depression went into remission.9

In regards to patients with anxiety, a meta-analysis of two dozen studies stated that overall, 65% of patients experienced less anxiety after psilocybin therapy treatment.10

It's clear that psilocybin therapy has the potential to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety."

#### PTSD Patients
"The symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder can persist for years after a traumatic event, and it can disrupt all facets of life. Psilocybin has been studied for usage with PTSD patients with positive results.11

Other psychedelics such as MDMA and ketamine have also been studied in PTSD."

#### Other Uses
"Studies have been published that have explored the use of psilocybin therapy for drug addiction, smoking cessation, Alzheimer's disease, and more.4"

## Benefits of Psilocybin Therapy 

"Specifically, studies have shown that12 "psilocybin is reported to result in significant changes in brain dynamics and functional connectivity (FC) between areas of the brain." This may help to explain why the results of its usage have been so dramatic, and why they have been more long-lasting than other forms of therapy."

#### Based on the various studies included in this article, the benefits of psilocybin therapy include the following:

-Reduced rates of depression
-Chronic depression moving into remission
-Lowered levels of anxiety
-Improved mood
-Less fear of the future
-Increased sense of spirituality and connection
-Enhanced quality of life
