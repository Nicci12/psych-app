## What is Psilocybin?

"Psilocybin or magic mushrooms are naturally occurring and are consumed for their hallucinogenic effects. 

They are psychedelic drugs, which means they can affect all the senses, altering a person’s thinking, sense of time and emotions. Psychedelics can cause a person to hallucinate, seeing or hearing things that do not exist or are distorted.1

The key ingredient in magic mushrooms is psilocybin. When psilocybin is taken, it’s converted in the body to psilocin, which is the chemical with the psychoactive properties.2"

## The Side Effects of Psilocybin 

"All hallucinogens carry the risk of triggering mental and emotional problems and causing accidents while under the influence. Among adolescents, magic mushrooms are frequently taken in combination with alcohol and other drugs, increasing the psychological and physical risks.

The amount of psilocybin and psilocin contained in any given magic mushroom is unknown, and mushrooms vary greatly in terms of the amount of psychoactive contents. This means that it is very hard to tell the length, intensity, and type of "trip" someone will experience.

Consuming shrooms can result in a mild trip, with feelings of relaxation or drowsiness, to a frightening experience marked by hallucinations, delusions, and panic. In the worst-case scenario, magic mushrooms have even been known to cause convulsions.11

Side effects of magic mushrooms can include both physical and mental effects".

##### Physical effects of psilocybin mushrooms include:

-Dilated pupils
-Drowsiness
-Headaches
-Increased heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature
-Lack of coordination
-Muscle weakness
-Nausea
-Yawning

###### Mental effects of shrooms are:

-Distorted sense of time, place, and reality
-Euphoria
-Hallucinations (visual or auditory)
-Having introspective (spiritual) experiences
-Nervousness
-Panic reactions
-Paranoia
-Psychosis
More research is needed on the long-term, lasting side effects of magic mushrooms. But it has been reported that people can experience long-term changes in personality, as well as flashbacks, long after taking mushrooms.

Since magic mushrooms look similar to poisonous mushrooms, poisoning is yet another potential risk of taking these drugs. Mushroom poisoning can cause severe illness, organ damage, and even death.

It's also common for magic mushroom products to be contaminated. A study of 886 samples alleged to be psilocybin mushrooms were analyzed by Pharm Chem Street Drug Laboratory. Only 252 (28%) were actually hallucinogenic, while 275 (31%) were regular store-bought mushrooms laced with LSD or phencyclidine (PCP) and 328 (37%) contained no drug at all"
## What do magic mushrooms look like?
"Magic mushrooms look much like ordinary mushrooms. 

There are many different types of magic mushrooms. The most common ones in Australia are called golden tops, blue meanies and liberty caps.3 Magic mushrooms look similar to poisonous mushrooms that can cause a person to become very sick and can result in death.

They can also come as dried material in capsules. Synthetic psilocybin appears as a white crystalline powder that can be processed into tablets or capsules or dissolved in water.4"

## How are magic mushrooms taken?
"Magic mushrooms are eaten fresh, cooked or brewed into a tea. The dried version is sometimes smoked, mixed with cannabis or tobacco".

## Effects of magic mushrooms

There is no safe level of drug use. Use of any drug always carries some risk. It’s important to be careful when taking any type of drug.

##### Magic mushrooms can affect everyone differently, based on:

-size, weight and health
-whether the person is used to taking it
-whether other drugs are taken around the same time
-the amount taken
-the strength of the mushroom (varies depending on the type of mushroom)
-the environment (where the drug is taken)


The effects of magic mushrooms usually begin in 30 minutes when eaten, or within 5–10 minutes when taken as a soup or tea and can last approximately four to six hours.3

#### During this time, the person may experience:

-euphoria and wellbeing
-change in consciousness, mood, thought and perception (commonly called a trip)
-dilation of pupils
-perceptual changes, such as visual and auditory hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t there, or are distorted)
-stomach discomfort and nausea
-headaches
-fast or irregular heartbeat
-increased body temperature
-breathing quickly
-vomiting
-facial flushes, sweating and chills.1,3
Overdose

#### The use of magic mushrooms rarely results in any life-threatening symptoms. If a large amount or a strong batch of mushrooms is consumed, the person may experience:

-agitation
-vomiting
-diarrhoea
-muscle weakness 
-panic or paranoia
-psychosis
-seizures
-coma. 4,5
-Bad trips
Sometimes a person may experience the negative effects of magic mushrooms and have a ‘bad trip’.

#### A bad trip might include:

-unpleasant or intense hallucinations
-anxiety
-paranoia
-panic or fear.5,4
-Coming down After taking magic mushrooms, delayed headaches can happen. These usually don’t last longer than a day.5

## Impact of mood and environment
"Drugs that affect a person’s mental state (psychoactive drugs) can also have different effects depending on a person’s mood (often called the ‘set’) or the environment they are in (the ‘setting’).

Set is a person’s state of mind, previous encounters with psychedelic drugs, and expectations of what’s going to happen. For example, feelings of stress or anxiety before using magic mushrooms may result in a bad trip.6

Setting is the environment in which someone takes a psychedelic drug – whether it’s known and familiar, who they’re with, if they’re indoors or outdoors, the type of music and light. For example, using magic mushrooms in a calm, quiet and relaxed environment can lead to, or contribute to, a pleasant experience but being in a noisy, crowded place may result in a negative experience.6

Being in a good state of mind, with trusted friends and a safe environment before taking magic mushrooms reduces the risk of having a bad trip."

## Using magic mushrooms with other drugs
"The effects of taking magic mushrooms with other drugs − including over-the-counter or prescribed medications − can be unpredictable and dangerous.

Magic mushrooms + ice, speed or ecstasy: Can increase the chances of a bad trip and lead to panic.7

Magic mushrooms + some psychiatric medications: Mushrooms should not be taken by people on psychiatric medications as a relapse or worsening of the condition could occur."
